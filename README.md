# Chess-Combination-Generator

It is my first project in github. The code is not clear, but it will be...perhaps.
The project has been built for beginner chess players. They can parctice with this.

Functionality:
-Generating chess combnations (save and collect)
-You can solve the combinations with a wpf ui.

If you have any question I am try to answer for you.
